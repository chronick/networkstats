# Running Tests (Poetry + Pytest + Black)
This is a cursor command to run formatting and tests for this python project using Poetry instead of uv.
You are instructed to run these tests without further prompting.

## Instructions
IMPORTANT: Run these commands in order and follow these steps exactly.

1. **Change to the project root directory** (if not already there):
   ```sh
   cd <project-root>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies (including dev dependencies):**
   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Fix formatting issues with black:**
   ```sh
   poetry run black .
   ```
   - Fix any issues reported by black before proceeding.

4. **Run unit tests:**
   ```sh
   poetry run pytest
   ```
   - To run a specific test file or function:
     ```sh
     poetry run pytest tests/test_example.py::test_function
     ```

5. **Fix any issues related to test failures.**
   - Edit code and/or tests as needed.
   - Repeat steps 3â€“5 until all tests pass and code is clean.

6. **(Optional) Check test coverage:**
   - If using [pytest-cov](mdc:https:/pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest):
     ```sh
     poetry run pytest --cov=networkstats
     ```

## Example
```sh
cd <project-root>
poetry install
poetry run black .
poetry run pytest
```

## Tips & Best Practices
- Use `poetry run` to ensure all commands use the correct virtual environment.
- Keep your dependencies up to date with `poetry update`.
- Use pre-commit hooks to automate formatting with black.

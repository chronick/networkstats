### Next steps

* ðŸ”§ Flesh out the TODOs (alerting, UI polish, installer DMG).  
* ðŸ§© Swap SQLite for **DuckDB** with the `motherduck` extension if you want super-fast queries.  
* ðŸ“Š Replace Plotly with **Altair/Vega-Lite** if you prefer pure JSON spec charts.

Happy hacking â€” and enjoy seamless dev in Cursor!

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **GUI Framework**: Toga (cross-platform) + rumps (macOS menu bar)
- **Database**: SQLite (current) → DuckDB (future)
- **Data Analysis**: Polars
- **Visualization**: Plotly (current) → Altair/Vega-Lite (future)
- **Packaging**: PyInstaller
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry

## Development Principles

1. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between monitoring, storage, and UI components
2. **Async-First**: Leverage Python's asyncio for efficient concurrent operations
3. **User Privacy**: All data stored locally, no external telemetry
4. **Performance**: Minimal resource usage, efficient data structures
5. **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for future enhancements
